  I/O Logic

remember how logic gates work
and their truth tables


Not   _
  x = a

Nand  ___
  x = a*b

Nor   ___
  x = a+b

And (logical product)
  x = a*b

or (logical sum)
  x = a+b

bool
  n inputs
  2^n possible results
  enumerate them
  truth table

Inverse
      _
  a + a = 1
      _
  a * a = 0

0,1

a + 1 = 1
a * 0 = 0

Associative
  a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
  a * (b * c) = (a * b) + c

Cumulative
  a + b = b + a
  a * b = b * a

Distributive
  a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)
  a + (b * c) = (a + b) * (a + c)

absrbtion
  a*(a+b) = a
  a + ab = a

DeMorgans law
  __   _   _
  ab = a + b
  _____ = _   _
  a + b = a * b

Mojority function
             _      _      _   ___
  f(a,b,c) = abc + abc + abc + abc
    product of sums (SOP)
  if most of your variables are 1 then the answer is 1
  if most of your variables are 0 then the answer is 0

MULTIPLEXORS



Question:
  What is this?
  f(a,b,c) = ab+ac

  a and b or a and c
