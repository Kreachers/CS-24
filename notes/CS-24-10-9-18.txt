convert SR latch to clock D-latch
clocked Dlatch
  - now there is only one input which prevents some illegal statements
  - the second input is now the clock signal

two D latches in series is a Flip Flop
  - flip flop is one bit of memory


FLOATING POINT IEEE 754
FUCKING KILL ME NOW

four rounding modes


single precision:   float    32 bit    8  bit exponent   23 bits significand  1 sign bit
double precision:   double   64 bit    11 bit exponent   52 bits significand  1 sign bit

sign  exp           significand
------------------------------------
|1|   8    |           23          |
------------------------------------
(-1)^sign * "1+significand" *2^(exponent-127)

significand finding procedure
  - *2, integer portion 0,1 -next digit of significand
  - fractional portion -> input for next round
  - repeat until hit 0 or run out of digits

  .75  *2  =  1.5
  .5   *2  =  1.0
  0   done
  11

  1.1*2^1
  GOOGLE IT

karnaugh maps
  - truth table or equation (SOP)
    - build table (karnough maps)
    - simplifing process (grouping of terms)
    - read off teh results

MIDTERM NEXT WEEK

no
  - karnough maps or IEEE
yes
  - adder decoder truthtable
  - between truth table equation and circuit conversion
  - circuits
  - at least one mips coding fragment
  - at least one given code to analyze
  - different registers, callee vs caller, s vs t registers, etc.
  - 2's complement
  - binary adding/subtraction/multiplication
  - basically anything from week 1 to 6
