Binary addition
twos complements
bias notation
binary coded decimal(BCD)
more binary stuff

binary division
  - skipping
  - more complicated then multiplication

binary multiplication
  - 3rd verion from the book
  - multiply to n bit numbers
    - 2n bit result
    - multiply 32 bit number needs 64 bits
    - $hi register for highest 32 bits
    - $lo register for lowest 32 bits
  Normal multiplication
      multiplicand
    x multiplier
      product
  binary multiplication
    |multiplicand|
    |  product   | multiplier |
  multiplicand in one register
  product/multiplier in another register
  product side starts as all zeros
  as you multiply the product side of the product/multiplier register will expand into the multiplier side
    |multiplicand|
    |         product         |
  Steps
    Repeat n times
    - examine least sig bit of product/multiplier register
      - if 1 add multiplicand to top half of product/multiplier register
    - shift product/multiplier right by 1
