# Welcome to Euclids GCD algorithm assmebly program
# this uses Euclids GCD algorithm

# The Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) is as follows:
# If A = 0 then GCD(A,B)=B, since the GCD(0,B)=B, and we can stop.
# If B = 0 then GCD(A,B)=A, since the GCD(A,0)=A, and we can stop.
# Write A in quotient remainder form (A = Bâ‹…Q + R)
# Where Q is the quotient of A/B
# And R is the remainder of A/B
# Find GCD(B,R) using the Euclidean Algorithm since GCD(A,B) = GCD(B,R)
